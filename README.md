# Map

Map is a straightforward app that utilises Apple's Core Location and MapKit frameworks. It is able to pinpoint your location and gives you the ability to drop a pin for directions to another position.

The Core Location framework is used to determine your positioning whilst the MapKit framework is used to give you the ability to find directions.
A simple green ‘Go‘ button is used to find directions to the where you’ve dropped the pin.

Once again, Map focuses on the integration and use of two key Apple frameworks, Core Location and MapKit. Whilst this project alone won’t be much use to an iOS user, it’s the implementation of these frameworks that has helped me understand the power available when using map functionality.

This project has helped me in the addition of map-based features for the current app I’m working on at Evident.
